# Twitter-Project
Approved a Developer account of Twitter. Created an app named Enviro in it. 
With pulling_tweets.py, I am trying to show how we can easily pull the tweets with Twitter API and Tweepy in python. 
Will conduct a sentiment analysis on what today's world think about Environment.
Will be evaluating the contribution of developing countries to it.
